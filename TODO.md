## TODO

- [ ] Move all routes from `StorageChangeLocationController` to `StorageLocationController`
- [ ] Change all calls on Postman to `storage-location`
- [ ] Follow body JSON data structure on Postman to fix DTO's
- [ ] Create route to delete permission
- [ ] Delete all unused methods and unnecessary comments
- [ ] Don't leave comments in spanish
- [ ] Routes to update should use PUT and usually (there are some exceptions) should pass the ID in the URL, example:
  .../storage-location/123. Fix the route to follow this.
- [ ] Put all calls in one folder on Postman
- [ ] Delete the not used calls on Postman 13
